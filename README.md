# Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Projects
Projects from Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp

These are some of the projects I completed as a part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp by Pierian Training on Udemy. I included extra analysis to practice technical skills and interpreting data in the projects' real-world contexts.

The projects are:
1. 911 Calls - basic data exploration and feature engineering using reall 911 call data from Kaggle
2. Ecommerce - linear regression with Scikit-Learn using simulated data (no real customer information)
3. Advertising - logistic regression with Scikit-Learn using simulated data
4. K Nearest Neighbors practice with simulated/anonymous data
5. Loans - decision tree and random forest analysis with Scikit-Learn using publicly available loan information from Lending Club
6. Iris - support vector machine analysis with Scikit-Learn using the Iris data set
7. Demographics - K means clustering with Scikit-Learn using real university demographics data
8. Natural Language Processing - NLP with Scikit-Learn using the Yelp data set from Kaggle
9. Loans (revisited) - neural network regression with Keras on the Lending Club loan data set
